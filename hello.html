        If you've ever been to Cusco, you may have seen Ausangate from a distance.
        Depending on the season, you may have noticed dark patches peeking through
        the clouds and wondered: What color is Ausangate? Or, you may be wondering
        what lies at the mountain's base. If you want to see the mountain more
        clearly, the best lookout from the city is at San Cristobal. If you want to
        see the mountain even closer, you may be ready for a trek to meet Ausangate
        yourself! We spoke with Noah, an adventure photographer from Peru, who
        shared his knowledge about the remarkable mountain.
